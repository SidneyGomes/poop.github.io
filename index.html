                                Over the next six years, we're going all out to promote POOP CITIZENS and build a
                                community as tight-knit as it is outrageous. With marketing campaigns that are
                                completely bonkers and partnerships that are off-the-wall, we're going to spread the

                                game on its head.
                                Using memecoins as Celebrity Avatars

                                about proving that even the biggest stars can't resist the allure of a good meme.
                                <br><br>Conclusion
